# My-Portfolio

Welcome to my portfolio website! This website showcases my projects, skills, and experiences as a developer.

## About Me

I like learning new things and getting my feet wet in new technologies and general learning.

## Goal

This website is for me to challege myself as a developer. I want to create things I don't use on a daily basis. I have created this website a while ago and is here now to update it with new life and to show what I have learned over the years. I will be updating this website every year or so as a yearly project adding new things to it that I think are cool. 

I will also be adding resturictions when creating these projects. With this project I will be using `Vim` to create the website and will not be using my normal editor.
